# 🤟 Sign Language Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to detect and recognize hand gestures representing **American Sign Language (ASL)** letters from image data or webcam input.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Detect hand gestures using image processing or webcam input.
- Train a model to classify signs corresponding to the ASL alphabet.
- Provide a simple and accessible way to bridge communication gaps using technology.

---

## 🧠 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras (or any ML model)
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🗃️ Dataset (if used)

- ASL Alphabet Dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or real-time hand signs)
- Image size normalization (e.g., 64x64 or 128x128)
- Grayscale or RGB based on model choice
- Augmentation for better generalization

---

## 🧪 Model Overview

- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to extract visual features
- Softmax layer for classification
- Categorical crossentropy loss
- Trained on A–Z (except possibly J and Z due to motion)
